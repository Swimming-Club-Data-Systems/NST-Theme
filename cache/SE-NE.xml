										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swim England will shortly be releasing its new Club Health Tracker to help clubs ‘streamline’ their club development work.</p>
<p>The tracker, delivered by Sporting Insights, is an online platform that will be used to support aquatic clubs with continuous improvements within six core areas of club development.</p>
<p>The six areas of coaching and teaching, financial management, pool operator relationships, governance and standards, growth, and volunteers will all be assessed as part of a self-assessment survey which clubs can complete in the tracker once a year.</p>
<p>After completing the survey, clubs will be shown an interactive results section which displays their scores compared to an average from other clubs up and down the country.</p>
<p>The aim is to help clubs identify their areas of strengths and weaknesses so they can target their development. The tracker also provides support to make those improvements with results catering to each individual clubs needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swim England have provided an update to the minimum depth of water required for swimmers to dive into a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Following a review by Swim England and in light of a number of ‘near misses’ which involved swimmers diving into shallow water, the new guidance states the minimum depth for dive entries should be 1.35m. With specific reference to swimming, this is in line with FINA Regulations.</p>
<p>Full details are available to view at: <a href="https://www.swimming.org/sport/minimum-entry-depth-guidance/">https://www.swimming.org/sport/minimum-entry-depth-guidance/</a></p>

<div></div>
<div>It was a fantastic weekend at the British Para Swimming Winter Championships held at Tollcross International pool in Glasgow, from 26-27th November.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Lucas Lee (S14), Doncaster Dartes, competed in the 14-17yrs age group. He managed to PB in 100m Free and 50 BR and a great 3 sec PB in the 200 free in the final session. Lucas had 4 top 10 placings at the event and when you are sharing the pool with some of the top swimmers in the GB team you have to be on top form. Well done Lucas.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Archie Hare (S11), Richmond Dales, had a 100% pb rate over the weekend with a fantastic 12 sec improvement in his 50m BC.<br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />Nathan Brown (S10), Richmond Dales, also had great weekend with a 3 sec improvement in his 400 FC and remaining close to his other best times throughout. <br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />Joe Field (S5), Richmond Dales, had a fantastic weekend with a huge 45 sec pb in his 200 FC and continued improvement in all his swims. Joe is still fighting back from major surgery but is proving that nothing will hold him back. <br aria-hidden="true" /><br aria-hidden="true" />Maisie Catt (S7), Richmond Dales, also had a great weekend with a 100% pb rate. Her stand out swims were 400 FC with a 13 sec improvement and a 6 sec improvement in her 50 BC. <br aria-hidden="true" />Maisie won a Silver medal in the 13 &amp; Under age group for 400 FC and 100 BC.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Josie Johnson (NE Disability / Darlington ASC) had a fantastic 100m free and produced an outstanding 8 sec PB followed by another improvement in her 50BR. There was no let up in performance for Josie with another improved time in the 50m Free. Finally the third session saw an awesome 8 sec PB in the 50m BC. A great performance from Josie.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Evie Lambert (S9), Borough of Kirklees, started the weekend with a great 3 sec improvement in her times for the 100m Free and 200IM and another PB in the 50m BR. Session 2 saw a great PB in the 100m BC. Session 3 saw another great improvement in the 50m BC and Evie finished off the final session with a great swim in the 100m Fly netting a fantastic 3 sec improvement on her entry time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Astrid Carroll (S13), Borough of Kirklees, had another great meet with a 3 sec improvement in 100 Free, a 2 sec PB in the 200IM, and another PB in 50m free. Astrid&#8217;s stand out swim was an amazing 20 sec improvement in her 400m free. Astrid finished top of her age group (13 &amp; Under) in all of her events, a fantastic achievement.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Andrew Beharie (S14), Blyth, made a 1 sec PB in the 50 Free and a 1 sec PB in the 100 Breaststroke.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Finally, we had our very own NER Para camp S &amp; C coach, Lyndon Longhorn (S4), Derwentside ASC. Lyndon swam in 5 events, 100m Free, 150m IM, 50m Free, 50m BC, 200m Free. He broke 5 British records and swam 2 lifetime best times.</div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div><em>Medals were awarded based on events that the swimmer can enter specific to their classification so although we had several 1st 2nd 3rd placings, if the events were not National para events for their classification, no medals were awarded.</em></div>

<p>The Swim England Awards kicked off with &#8216;Volunteer of the Year,&#8217; which Helen Dutton won in recognition of her contribution to aquatics!</p>
<p>Helen Dutton, Volunteer of the Year, said she was &#8216;overwhelmed&#8217; after receiving a Swim England National Award.</p>
<p>This year, the &#8216;tireless&#8217; City of Leeds Diving Club volunteer served as the regional lead for the Swim England National Skills Final, and her &#8216;dilligence, selflessness, and passion&#8217; for the sport contributed to the event&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>She is also the diving manager for the North East Region and was quick to praise everyone in the diving community.</p>

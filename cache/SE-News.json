importance to us.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is our legal and moral responsibility to ensure that swimmers diving into the water are not put at risk in any way and the changes being introduced are based purely on health and safety grounds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs FINA has introduced a new increased depth, we are therefore aligning our minimal starting depths with that of the International body.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Considerations clubs and operators should take not only include the water depth but also pool space, organisation and discipline, the dive itself and ensuring that participants are spaced out sufficiently and are stationary on the poolside when executing their dive.<\/p>\n<p>Members are reminded that only those swimmers who have reached the standard of the Swim England Preliminary Competitive Start Award are permitted to start with a shallow racing dive from the side of the pool.<\/p>\n<p>Swimmers who have not reached this standard must start in the
